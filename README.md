This was a virtual internship experience offered by KPMG through InsideSherpa which provides some insights into the sort of work done by KPMGâ€™s Analytics, Information & Modelling group. I completed all three modules:

Data Quality Assessment: I provided a concise report to a hypothetical client on the quality of three data sets provided by that client to the KPMG data consulting team. This involved assessing qualities such as accuracy, completeness and validity and making recommendations on how to clean the data for use in later analysis.

Data Insights: I proposed a plan for predicting which customers in a new data set would likely be high value to the client. This involved using the three data sets from the first module to calculate a metric measuring a customer's value, then fitting a random forest model using predictors from these data sets to make predictions about which new customers from an unlabelled set would likely be high value.

Data Insights and Presentation: Once the predictions were made about which customers would be high value, I created a dashboard with interactive linked visualisations of the results for presentation to the client, breaking down the most valuable customers by geographic region, wealth segment and frequency of past purchases.

I coded the first two modules in R and produced a set of slides for the second module in Google Sheets. The visualisations in the third module were done in Tableau Public and can be found on my Tableau Public page: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ben.crabtree7376#!/vizhome/SprocketPredictedProfitDashboard/KPMGPredictedProfitDashboard
